# Overview 

This is a retro 8-bit implementation of the 2025 HTN Frontend Challenge. This hackathon was branded a generic hackathon through the "Hackthon Inc." brand. The main purpose of this interface was to display events generated from the backend. This website is deployed on the 
following domain: https://htn-frontend-challenge-2025.vercel.app/ 

I've documented the functionality of this app through this video.

# WRITE-UP
# 1. Walk us through your development process as you worked on this project. How did you plan out the structure and design of it? How did decide on the tools you've used? Did you encounter any problems? And if so, how did you solve them? Are there any areas of your code that you're particularly proud of or want to point out?

# 2. Given additional time, how would you extend your application to become a fully functional product that thousands of hackers and the general public would use at Hackathon Global Inc.â„¢'s next event? Would you add more features and performance metrics? If so, what would they be?


# 3. Any other thoughts you have (not limited to the previous questions).
